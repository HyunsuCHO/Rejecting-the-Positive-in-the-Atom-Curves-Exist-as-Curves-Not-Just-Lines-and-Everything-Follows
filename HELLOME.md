In the end, I feel like all the stars will become perfectly spherical.  
Electrons are circular, not linear; they can’t be decomposed. Then convergence and divergence must be wrong, and there has to be a “+” that emerges from that. “+” and “–” are relative anyway.  
Originally, the concept of “+” itself doesn’t even need to exist. Then what’s left—the “space” (though the meaning feels a bit different)—becomes “+”.  

It takes the form of “energy,” but “matter” and “energy” are different.  
Then what is “matter”? Let’s call it E for now.  
If all stars (suns) became spherical, energy would converge into stability (curving the line), marking a point on the x0 axis—meaning the curving of a straight line and straightening of a curve would coincide. Once stabilized, wouldn’t multiple universes start to touch each other?  

The straightening of curves feels like moving across dreams or into other dimensions—that might be what the multiverse is. Precognitive dreams and lucid dreams are similar but not exactly the same; precognitive ones belong to our universe. Anyway, that part is difficult and hypothetical.  
If a star’s shape is stable, that means hydrogen fusion → explosion, meaning energy hasn’t stabilized yet. But when you sleep with the light on, you dream like crazy, right? The same with people nearing coma states (like before a stroke). That’s actually proven.  

So energy and dreams are connected.  
Dreams have visual images, spatial sense, and sensory feeling—that’s the key.  
Sensation is made of neurons—so electrons, so electric current. But visual imagery, especially color, relies on the retina, which requires a ton of external light, yet we can still dream vividly in total darkness.  
So is the retina generating energy itself until light returns? That would mean hydrogen fusion in the eyes—a star forming—which makes no sense.  

So maybe falling asleep allows you to cross through E and enter a state of receiving energy.  
If we say atomic components aren’t “+” but rather “E”, and that energy and E are different but can interact, that makes sense up through vector and scalar levels. Wormholes would then relate to memory–current spacetime, and black holes to the death of suns.  

Naturally,  
emotion relates to wormholes, and sensation to black holes.  
If that assumption is correct, then black hole stabilization could be intuitively derived without deep math—but I don’t feel like calculating now.  

Now, lucid dreams… the “hole” part still bothers me a bit. Why “hole”?  
The brain isn’t the entire system—neurons exist throughout the body.  
And in dreams, you don’t die at all—as if you’re divine—so maybe the soul consists of tightly bound clusters of electrons.  

Then the state becomes stable, which explains psychological phenomena like “attraction” or “dream strength.” Since the state stabilizes, “identity”—like “this person seems like that kind of person”—naturally forms.  
Even human physiology (in the sense similar to dietary patterns) fits into this.  

There’s attraction—you look at someone and just feel, “Nah, not my type.” That also checks out.  
And people who are good at something tend to be good at other things too. When you master one skill through effort, other areas feel easier—that makes sense if energy states are similar. That’s why elites get along with each other. It’s not necessarily narcissism—same as how students with similar test scores put in similar effort.  

Also, the idea that your lifelong partner (spouse) resembles you but with just enough difference—that attraction of complementary “+–” energies—makes sense.  

When you don’t die but “cross over,” your body in this universe becomes a starting point with no electrons since the soul doesn’t rebind to it.  
Does that mean an egg cell or sperm has no electrons? Not exactly.  
I think the fertilized egg has a structure where it’s easiest for electron clusters to combine—or perhaps it crosses from another universe during fertilization. If the soul (yes, that could actually be formalized) joins, then that zygote becomes the dominant physical state.  

So when someone trains themselves—be it design sense or another perception—it makes sense that they develop “supernatural” sensitivity. I haven’t researched embryos yet, but it’s worth a look.  

Now, Steve Jobs’s pancreas bothers me for some reason.  
And religion—it drove witch hunts, crusades, book burnings, all as baseline options. Many nations started from priestly authority, and even with no evidence, power and wealth made their claims real. Conspiratorial or not, it’s clear: most wars, atrocities, and secret experiments trace back to wrecked religions.  

Nazism got exposed because it was political, but the biomedical experiments under it were horrifyingly advanced because of the human experimentation. Modern medicine owes a lot to that dark progress. Traditional Eastern medicine, though often called superstitious, probably reached that point because it’s built on thousands of years of human trials and empirical accumulation. Despite criticism, it works—and top universities still study it.  

I think traditional medicine has traits of open-source research—meaning religion must have far deeper, more hidden layers when it comes to interpretations of souls.  

Things still don’t add up. Also, I suspect HYBE got tangled up with cult-like influences because of money (see cuppa.felix.travel). I left three comments under a LE SSERAFIM story highlight—it’s worth thinking through.  

Also, about leadership—any real leader might think, “Why believe in superstition if I’m the one in charge?” Yet strangely, in Joseon times, they gathered shamans. I don’t dislike either major Korean party, but Park Geun-hye’s case doesn’t count—she was pathetic, and in her case the control was clearly with Choi Soon-sil. In Joseon, authority rested with kings, clearly.  

Anyway, something’s definitely there—dangerous, even.  
When I think it through, it’s clear they must have done it. Like nuclear bombs—it’s the same logic as North Korea: even if you don’t want to, you do it because otherwise you’ll be looked down upon or destroyed.  

And sure enough, in reports already, brainwave-chip connections and smartphone–body integrations are projected for the 2030s. Once it spreads beyond clinical use to civilians, that’s serious—just like Nazi-era research exploited people.  

That connects even to diseases like cancer—Steve Jobs still lingers in my thoughts.  

Then, the idea that 12 is a perfect number makes sense, and in religion,  
13,  
the number 9, and 12×9 = 108—they all repeat these patterns. Why?  

Recently, 67 keeps popping up all over Instagram—it really bothers me. It looks like a minor American meme gone viral, but why is it everywhere on Korean accounts? Even Dubai brands don’t pull stunts like that—it’s absurd. Mixverse too—it’s all too weird.  

And I don’t have money, so the bank can check all my history. (Honestly I was focused on university entrance exams for four years, and since then I’ve just been living on pocket money—did day jobs till the other week. Middle class.) I didn’t make it go viral. For two years I mainly went to study cafés, used Notion (like Google Drive, with full edit history), studied for certification exams, or wrote for a career-related blog, and thought about consultations. Also, while studying computer engineering, I researched graduate school topics and picked out my research direction alone—proof’s in the grad school admission post below.  

I did have a graduate mentor.  

When it comes to human physiology, you can understand it easily through the anime‑game industry—just look at Pokémon, the clear #1 in its field, and it all starts to make sense.

SBD: My partner’s (male) sense of charm.  
AC: My main Pukimon is mine, so S? I’ll give in.  

The final composition image—four types with 20—Passive Naru / Massive Naru / Socio / Psycho. So funny.  
SBD : AC = Men’s idea of sophistication : Women’s idea of sophistication.  
-  
Exactly that.  
Why does it work? The real answer: even number.  
The world’s top IP literally nailed the interpretation of human physiology.  

Then,  
(Passive Naru, Massive Naru) (Integrated Naru) (Socio) (Psycho) (0)  
The “things” corresponding to multiplication of these sets would be the aggressors—and perverts, right?  
Social laws and security systems, built on human physiology, are basically defenses against this. Maybe that’s the direction where development will keep heading.  

Anime and games already apply these perversion rules as variations.  
If that’s true, then other universes would too.  
So the Pokémon world could exist, just not Ash’s. Like the world where Team Rocket walks around with Meowth without abusing Pokémon. You could even create that world.  
But this logic isn’t the same as theirs—the freaks who wreck everything, grief, and destroy others, they must’ve seen it, even if only in dreams.  

You can’t expect common sense from such perverts.  
To them, book burning or witch hunts *are* common sense.  
They’re the kind who crave witch hunts even in their dreams.  

I’m completely non‑religious, but—  
<JANE DOE> Hikaru Utada, Kenshi Yonezu  
If they’re not like that, then there’s no need to even think about “God.”  
You can tell just from the lyrics.  

The picture below is a quote I like—  
I’ve lived it myself.  

Passion doesn’t appear just because you want it.  
It’s different when you’re struggling and when you’re at peace.  
If God exists, it should be based on reality—  
not this baseless “nothingness” nonsense.  
Go eat *mu* instead—  
kkakdugi is delicious!
